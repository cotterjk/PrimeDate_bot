# Prime Factorization Of The Date, Twitter Bot

A twitter bot that, each morning, tweets the prime factorization of the date converted to a whole number. (For example, December 25, 1996 becomes 122596.)

According to the [fundamental theorem of arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic),
not only can every integer greater than 1 be represented as a product of primes, but that it can only be repesented like this in exactly one way. (122596 = 2 x 2 Ã— 30649.)

My first bot, this is meant to illustrate how each day is similarly special.

Watch it go [@primedate_bot](https://twitter.com/primedate_bot)

## Details

The code is pushed to a Heroku app, and tweets once a day at 7am EDT using a Heroku scheduler, calling `tweet`. It can also be manually triggered to tweet by navigating to the local repository and running `heroku run tweet`.
